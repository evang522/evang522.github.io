          <u>About me</u>
        </div>
        Hi, I'm Evan! I'm a Full Stack Developer with training in Node, MongoDB, React, Express, and best practices in Javascript application development. I have a background in Business Tech Support as a Desktop/Server Engineer and have been employed in several tech jobs throughout my life and career. Information Technology to me seems an endless source of possibility. I've decided to spend my time teasing out those possibilities with code. 
        <br><br>
        In early 2018 I attended <a href='https://thinkful.com'>Thinkful's</a> fullstack Javascript 'Engineering Immersion Course' and learned a full suite of skills in developing in REST API, MERN stack Javascript Applications. Embracing the model of learning we used at Thinkful, I enjoy learning new technologies and adding them to my repertoire of tools to solve architectural problems in developing applications.
        <br><br>
        When I am not coding or fiddling around with computers, I'm usually reading history and philosophy, challenging myself to learn more German or Spanish, or outside enjoying the beautiful world we live in with my wife Jodi. I love exploring places off the beaten path and finding old artifacts from times past in doing so. Also, mountains are my favorite place to spend my time outside.

            What I'm Working On At the Moment
          </div>
          As someone who enjoys using Slack, one of the things I've always wanted to do is create my own version of it. So right now I'm working on creating a realtime, channel based, data-persistent messenging client. The tech stack I am using is Node.js, MongoDB, Express, React, Redux, and Socket.io to manage realtime updates for clients, in a multi-room setup. If you're interested, feel free to check out my <a href='https://github.com/evang522/hermes-client'>client</a> and <a href='https://github.com/evang522/chatapp-server'>server</a> code repos as I work through it.
