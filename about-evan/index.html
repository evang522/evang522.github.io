        <b>Who Am I?</b>
        <br><br>
        Hi, I'm Evan! I'm a Full Stack Developer from the U.S. with 3+ years of experience in Fullstack development of Typescript and PHP applications. I have a background in business tech support and server management, but naturally my favorite area to work is in the code! I love being 'hacky' and going deep into libraries and framework implementations to better understand what goes on 'under the hood'. But what is most important to me is the art of designing applications and implementing software which best communicates the domain for which it exists.
        <br><br>
        <b>What is Important to Me as a Developer?</b>
        <br><br>
        The most valuable things I have learned about software have less to do with language or implementation details and more about designing classes which reflect the way a system works in reality and which provide excellent tools to further the development process. I have learned to place a high value of principles of design, which make software scalable, readable, manageable, enjoyable to work with, and communicative of the domain for which it exists. I am currently working on documenting these principles <a href="https://www.notion.so/Principles-of-Design-6134fad6f2644f9fb03c96187af44b51">here</a> if you would like to take a look!
         <br><br>
          <b>Do I Have any Life Outside of Being Nerd?</b>
        <br><br>
        Of course :D When I am not coding or fiddling around with computers, I'm usually a classic bookworm, reading history, philosophy, C.S. Lewis, or any other book I can get my hands on that will promote understanding and learning. I love challenging myself to learn more German, Latin, and Greek, and also being outside enjoying the beautiful world we live in, with my wife Jodi. I love exploring places off the beaten path and finding old artifacts from times past in doing so. Also, mountains are my favorite place to spend my time outside. 
        <br><br>
        <b>What I'm Working On At the Moment</b>
        <br><br>
          I am working full time as a Fullstack Developer (React Frontend / Symfony PHP Backend) at <a href='https://fitfox.de'>Fitfox GmbH</a> remotely from Th√ºringen, Germany. When I'm not working for Fitfox, I devote much of my time as the full stack developer for <a href="https://glaubensfutter.de">Glaubensfutter</a>, an organization which facilitates the translation of English theology and apologetics into German via volunteer coordination. I also work on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/memento/jfpnlhmdmlfbjejmnfgacgkkligneihb">Memento Notepad</a> in any leftover time.
